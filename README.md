# Scriptable: Crowdfunding Project State (wemakeit)

While running our Crowdfunding campaign with [wemakeit](https://wemakeit.com) we found ourselves checking the campaign every now and then, maybe a bit too often. This finding sparked the idea of writing a script that checks the state of our crowdfunding by asking Siri.

## Usage

- Download [Scriptable](https://scriptable.app/) from the App Store
- Add new script
- Copy and paste the content of `scriptable-project-state.js`
- Adjust content of `projectSlug`
- Run script
- Make script available to Siri by configuring «Siri Shortcut» in the scripts setting

## Caution

- This script is an early beta. We are making use of the XML-version of the project page, which might change and cause the script to break. Try at your own risk.
